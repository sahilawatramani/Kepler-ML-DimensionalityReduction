# Kepler-ML-DimensionalityReduction

This project works with data from NASA's Kepler mission, specifically focusing on the search for exoplanets.

The following algorithms have been implemented:

1. PCA
2. LDA
3. t-SNE
4. MDS

These algorithms are also visualised with the help of variance plots, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.
